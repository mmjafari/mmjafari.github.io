* Preliminaries

** Hillbert's 10th Problem

#+attr_latex: :options {Question}
#+begin_block 
Given a number field $k$, is there any algorithm to determine whether a
polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ admits a solution in $k$?
#+end_block

#+attr_Latex: :options {Answer}
#+begin_block
$k = \mathbb{Z} \to$ No. [Davis-Putnam-Robinson + Matiyasevich]

$k = \mathbb{Q} \to$ Yes in one variable, unknown in general.
#+end_block

** Mordell-Weil Theorem

#+attr_latex: :options [Mordell-Weil-Faltings]
#+begin_theorem 
Given a variety $C$ of genus $g$, the set $C(\mathbb{Q})$ is determined as

$g = 0 \to 0, \infty$

$g = 1 \to G \times \mathbb{Z}^r$

$g \ge 2 \to$ finite
#+end_theorem

We now focus on the case $g = 1$.

** Elliptic Curves

#+begin_definition
An /elliptic curve/ $E$ over a number field $k$ is a smooth, projective
algebraic variety which in $Char(k) \ne 2,3$ can be expressed as
$$y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$$
#+end_definition

It follows from the theorem above that
$E/\mathbb{Q} \simeq E_{tors} \times \mathbb{Z}^r$

** Selmer groups

Given two elliptic curves $E,E'$ and isogenies $\varphi,\varphi'$ we have
$$0 \longrightarrow E[\varphi] \longrightarrow E \longrightarrow E'
\longrightarrow 0$$
which produces the exact sequence of Galois cohomology
$$0 \longrightarrow E'(k)/\varphi(E(k))
\overset{\delta_k}{\longrightarrow} H^1(k,E[\varphi]) \longrightarrow
H^1(k,E)[\varphi] \longrightarrow 0$$
where $\delta_k$ is the connecting homomorphism.

For each \nu-adic completion of $k$ we define the following groups
$$Sel^\varphi(E/k) = Ker\{H^1(k,E[\varphi]) \to \prod_\nu H^1(k_\nu, E)[\varphi]\}$$
$$\Sh(E/k) = Ker\{H^1(k,E) \to \prod_\nu H^1(k_\nu, E)\}$$

** Selmer groups

These two groups form the short exact sequence
$$0 \longrightarrow E'(\mathbb{Q})/\varphi(E(\mathbb{Q}))
\longrightarrow Sel^\varphi(E/\mathbb{Q}) \longrightarrow
\Sh(E/\mathbb{Q})[\varphi] \longrightarrow 0$$

It holds that
$$rank(E/\mathbb{Q}) \le dim_{\mathbb{F}_2}Sel^\varphi(E/\mathbb{Q}) +
dim_{\mathbb{F}_2}Sel^{\varphi'}(E'/\matnbb{Q}) - 2$$

** Tamagawa ratios
#+attr_latex: :options [Tamagawa ratio]
#+begin_definition
The ratio
$$\mathscr{T}(E/E') = \frac{|Sel^\varphi(E/K)|}{|Sel^{\varphi'}(E'/K)|}$$
is called the /Tamagawa ratio/ associated to isogenues curves.
#+end_definition

In [KLO13,KLO14] the distribution of these ratios in isogenous families
and quadratic twists is used to study the Selmer ranks.

* 2-Torsion families

** Elliptic Curves with a 2-Torsion
Consider a family of curves $E_r$ with a given 2-torsion point $(r,0)$. Such family
can be parametrized as
$$E_r : y^2 = x^3 + tx - rt -r^3$$
which after a translation $(r,0) \mapsto (0,0)$ becomes
$$E : y^2 = x^3 + 2rx^2 + (r^2+t)x$$
equipped with an isogenous curve
$$E' : y^2 = x^3 - 6rx^2 - (3r^2+4t)x$$

** Elliptic Curves with a 2-Torsion
Certain results are known about the average ranks of such families; in
particular, we have the following

#+attr_latex: :options [Klagsburn-Lemke Oliver]
#+begin_theorem
Given a family of elliptic curves with a 2-torsion, the rank $Sel_2(E/\mathbb{Q})$
grows with respect to the height of the family (e. g, the average is not a
constant).
#+end_theorem

We would like to examine further the properties of Selmer group given $r,t$.

** Connecting Homomorphisms and Selmer Groups
in [G02], two alogorithms are given for calculation of connecting
homomorphisms $\delta_p$ and $\delta_2$. These images are used coupled with the definition
#+BEGIN_multline*
$S^\varphi(E/\mathbb{Q}) = \{x \in H^1(\mathbb{Q},E[\varphi])\  | \ res_p(x) \in Im(\delta_p)\
\text{for all places }p\} \\ = \bigcap Im(\delta_p)$
#+END_multline*
to describe the full Selmer group.

** Algorithms for $\delta_p$
In an elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + Bx$, let
$a = ord_p(A), b = ord_p(B), d = ord_p(A^2-4B)$.

The algorithms deal with $b = 0,1,2,3$ for all $p$, fully
reproducing the Selmer groups.

We observe that in case $b \ge 1$ and $a \ge 2$, we have
$E : y = x^3 + pA'x + p^2B'x$ is a quadratic twist $E^p$, thus
the algorithm above can recursively construct the Selmer
group for higher cases omitted in the description.

* Our work

** Statistical Arguements for the Selmer ranks
Since the algorithm roughly implies a direct relation
between upper bound of Selmer ranks and the order $b$, we can deduce the
following upper bound for the $p$ part of the image
$$sup(\delta_p) \sim \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{n}{p^{n+1}} = \frac{p}{(p-1)^2}$$

Adding all the contributions of primes $p$ up to the naive height
$X$ of the curve family we get
$$sup(r) \sim \sum_{p \text{ prime}}^X \frac{p}{(p-1)^2} \sim \sum_p^X \frac{1}{p} \sim \log(\log(x))$$

** Statistical Arguments for the Selmer ranks
The observation above agrees with [KLO13] and [KK17], in which the distribution
for Selmer ranks of quadratic twists is observed to fall in the
normal distribution $\mathscr{N}(0, \frac{1}{2}\log\log X)$, following different methods.

** Other implications
Given the direct relation of orders, for the curve with 2-torsion
at $(r,0)$ we expect the highest relation with the order of $2$ in $r$,
as $ord_2(A) \ge 1$ is most likely to result in non-trivial Selmer group.
We can observe this by taking the average rank for $0<r \le 100$ and
$0 < t \le 10,000$, plotted in the following figure
